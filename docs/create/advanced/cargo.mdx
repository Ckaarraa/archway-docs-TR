title: Managing Dependencies

# What is [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) really?
> _Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs dependencies.)_

## Cargo.toml

The Cargo.toml file at the root of an Archway project is called its [manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_file), and contains all of the metadata Cargo needs to compile your smart contract project and its dependencies. Every manifest file consists of one or more sections.

The following sections are some examples commonly found in Archway projects:

- `[package]` - The first section in a Cargo.toml is always `[package]` and must include the metadata properties `name` and `version`
- `[lib]` - Library target settings
- `[profile.release]` - This section is for setting your build profile. Cargo has 4 built-in profiles: `dev`, `release`, `test`, and `bench`.
- `[features]` - Conditional compilation features
- `[package.metadata.scripts]` - This section is part of the `cargo-run-script` module, it's where scripts are defined. If you are familiar with node, `cargo-run-script` brings the `npm run` functionality to the Rust and Cargo ecosystem
- `[dependencies]` -  Use this section for defining your project's external dependencies
- `[dev-dependencies]` - Use this section for defining dependencies for examples, tests, and benchmarks

[For a full list of possible sections and valid properties, see the Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html)

## Semantic Versioning

Cargo bakes in the concept of Semantic Versioning. It is configured to look for dependencies on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) by default. Only the name and a version string are required in this case.

Example:

```toml
[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = "1.0.0-beta"
```
