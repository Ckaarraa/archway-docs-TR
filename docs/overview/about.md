# About Archway

Archway is an incentivized smart contract platform that rewards developers — ushering in next gen dApps.

The protocol gives developers the tools to easily build and launch scalable cross-chain dApps, and get rewarded for the value they contribute to the network.

## The Archway Mission

The overarching goal of Archway is to foster an arrary of diverse and sustaibable applications by empowering and rewarding developers that build on Archway network with baked in incentives and rewards.  

The internet helped to democratize access to information, but it hasn’t fully democratized access to capital markets. Entrepreneurs and developers around the world lack access to the same opportunities as their counterparts in more developed nations.

Archway is on a mission to help change this inequity. 

Archway treats all developers and entrepreneurs around the world fairly, no matter their background or location. Built into the Archway protocol itself, Archway rewards developers based on the value and impact of their dApp, rather than their close association or connections to capital.

Unlike existing Web 2.0 platforms or early versions of Web3 layer 1s, where tokens are mostly concentrated in the hands of the first few early participants, the Archway community believes that all contributors should be able to participate in the community they help build.

The Archway protocol is designed to be shared with all contributors and all stakeholders, irrespective of their initial stakes or their current financial means. Growth and governance are shared with the entrepreneurs and developers who are building on the protocol. Archway is designed to build a world that is more accessible.


## Mission Statement

Archway is on a mission to inspire the next generation of dapps by creating a new blockchain ecosystem that rewards developers

## Our Story 

Archway supports developers with toolchains, networks, and long-term rewards for building successful dapps. By providing a WASM implementation, a Web3-compatible API, and bridges that connect with other networks, you can easily and quickly deploy smart contracts and user-friendly front ends. Built in the Cosmos ecosystem, your dapp will already be interoperable with thousands of other chains thanks to the IBC. This makes for seamless connectivity for your dapp users, project supporters, and Cosmos community.

Archway is the first developer ecosystem to offer both transaction fees and inflationary rewards for their contributors. We believe that successful dapps are the most critical component of a successful network, so you should be rewarded for your creativity and contributions. As your dapp grows users, you’re able to earn a steady stream of revenue to pay yourself, your team, and continue to develop future versions of your dapp. Now, you can focus on your tech without worrying about how to fund your projects. We can’t wait to see what you create.

## Archway Manifesto

We’re revolutionizing how businesses are built, art is created, and success is shared. We’re the developers, technologists, artists, and entrepreneurs of the future— all unified for the cause of creating a platform that shares rewards. We represent more than just blockchain technology. We embody a cultural movement where the future is fair, and creators can benefit from their contributions. By revolutionizing the way dapps are built, we’re creating a digital world in which rewards are shared with developers, technologists, artists, and entrepreneurs. 

See it all happening on Archway.
