# About Archway

## The Archway Mission
Archway is a self sovereign network that allows creators express their creativity and be rewarded for it.

Archway makes it easy to develop decentralized applications and services. By empowering developers and sharing part of the network growth we allow incentivized innovation.

## Archway Mission Statement

The internet has helped to democratize access to information, but it hasn’t fully democratized access to capital markets. Entrepreneurs and developers around the world don’t have access to the same opportunities as their counterparts living in developed nations have. 

Archway is on a mission to help change all this. 

Archway treats all developers and entrepreneurs around the world fairly, no matter their background or location. Built into the Archway protocol itself, Archway rewards developers based on the value and impact of their dapp, rather than their close association to capital.

Unlike existing Web 2.0 platforms or early versions of Web 3.0 layer 1’s, where tokens are mostly concentrated in the hands of the first few early participants, the Archway community believes that all contributors should be able to participate in the community they help build.

Archway protocol is designed to be shared with all contributors and all stakeholders, irrespective of their initial stakes or their current financial means. Both appreciation and governance is shared with the entrepreneurs and developers building on the protocol, which is all designed to build a world that is more accessible.
