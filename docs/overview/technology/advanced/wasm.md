# Wasm
> *WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
> Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.*

WebAssembly encodes a low-level, assembly-like programming language. In order to ensure developer interoperability we use a custom WebAssembly distribution. 

You can find the up-to-date spech for WebAssembly [here](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/overview.html)


# CosmWasm
CosmWasm is built as a cosmos-sdk module in order to allow sovereign chains to run smart contracts. It leverages Wasm to provide safe, easy to use binaries that may cross programming language barriers.

You can find more infromation on CosmWasm [here.](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/0.16/architecture/multichain)
