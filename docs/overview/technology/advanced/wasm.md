# Wasm
In order to ensure developer interoperability we use a custom WebAssembly distribution. 

> *WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
> Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.*

# CosmWasm
CosmWasm is built as a cosmos-sdk module in order to allow sovereign chains to run smart contracts. It leverages Wasm to provide safe, easy to use binaries that may cross programming language barriers.
