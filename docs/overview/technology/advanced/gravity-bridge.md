# Gravity Bridge
Gravity Bridge is a bidirectional bridge to Ethereum and eventually other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains

Archway will provide a native Gravity Bridge integration so developers can pull Ethereum assets such as ERC-20s and ERC-721s into their dApps and bring their own assets to Ethereum. 

You can find more information on the Gravity Bridge [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gravity-bridge)
