# Economic Overview
Archway allows each dApps and their communities to configure how the funds are managed and distributed. When instantiating a contract, the dApp creator specifies an “owner” address where all fees and rewards are automatically deposited. This target address can be their own, a multisig, or controlled by a separate custom contract. Ownership can then be transferred to a new address as needed, only requiring the signature of the previous owner. 
 
Archway seeks to provide three potential funding sources for dApps:

- Gas fee rebates 
- Share of inflationary rewards
- Smart contract fees (optional)

With Archway, dApps earn both transaction fees and inflationary rewards in exchange for their contributions to the network. This earning model is similar to how validators are rewarded for operating nodes in a typical Proof-of-Stake chain.
