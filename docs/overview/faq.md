# FAQ

## What is Archway?
Archway is an incentivized smart contract chain for Cosmos, allowing developers to easily deploy high-performance dApps and get rewarded for the value they contribute to the network.


## Why Archway?
Developers build and launch impactful dApps that generate usage on Archway, they earn a proportional share of network fees and rewards. This shared earning model enables them to potentially access recurring streams of funding and participate in the upside of the protocol’s success.

Along with a more inclusive rewards model, Archway’s technical design is optimized for a seamless developer experience. The protocol provides a full WebAssembly (Wasm) implementation for cross-language support, a Web3-compatible API, and native bridges that connect to other networks for cross-chain communication and asset transfers.

## Does Archway have a native staking token ?
Yes, Archway has a native staking token and is used for governance of the protocol.
This helps maintain and support Archway’s decentralized community while ensuring fair and transparent participation. All holders of the native token can propose changes to the Archway protocol and vote on active proposals. Proposals that reach a consensus threshold are adopted, whether a specific feature or even changing the governance system itself.

## Will there be an airdrop?
We do believe in rewarding early contributors and adopters of the protocol, but at this time we are working through all applicable laws across multiple jurisdictions. Please subscribe to our email newsletter for further information. 

## Will there be a Cosmos Community airdrop?
We do believe it is important to reward the Cosmos community, but at this time we are working through all applicable laws across multiple jurisdictions. Please subscribe to our email newsletter for further information.

## When will Archway Launch?
The protocol is aiming to go live by summer 2022
