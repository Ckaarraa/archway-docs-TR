# FAQ

## What is Archway?
Archway is an incentivized smart contract chain for Cosmos, allowing developers to easily deploy high-performance dApps and get rewarded for the value they contribute to the network.


## Why Archway?
Developers build and launch impactful dApps that generate usage on Archway, they earn a proportional share of network fees and rewards. This shared earning model enables them to potentially access recurring streams of funding and participate in the upside of the protocol’s success.

Along with a more inclusive rewards model, Archway’s technical design is optimized for a seamless developer experience. The protocol provides a full WebAssembly (Wasm) implementation for cross-language support, a Web3-compatible API, and native bridges that connect to other networks for cross-chain communication and asset transfers.


## When will Archway Launch?
TBD.
