# Participate in Staking (Delegation)

Intro to staking: invest in the network's security and get rewards

## Staking

First open your `keplr` browser extension and click on the `Stake` button.

**Prerequisite:** Make sure to deposit some tokens beforehand.

After you click the `Stake` button, the `keplr` extension opens the `keplr web wallet`. 
In the list of validators, select the one you want and then select `Manage`.

**Warning:** Conduct proper research about the validator before staking your tokens with them.

Enter the amount of tokens that you want to stake.

**Note:** Since there is a transaction fee, make sure not to delegate all your tokens.

After you select the `Delegate` button, another window allows you to select the transaction fees. If you want your transaction to be processed faster, you can offer a higher fee.

## Undelegate and Redelegate

To undelegate your staked tokens, select the validator from the list of validators in your `keplr web wallet` and then select the `Undelegate` button.

**Note:** The unbonding period in Cosmos-based networks is `21` days.
