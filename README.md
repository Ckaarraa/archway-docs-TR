# Archway Docs Website

The [Archway Docs](https://docs.archway.io/docs/overview/about/) website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

To install the docs build environment:

```console
npm install
```

## Local Development

```console
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
